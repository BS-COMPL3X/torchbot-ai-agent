Bespoke websites and products tailored to your organisation’s unique needs.
We can help simplify your back-office processes including seamless integration with CRMs, payment gateways, ticketing platforms and email systems.
Move your website to Wagtail, the leading open-source Python CMS.
It’s fast, simple to use and powerful enough to handle even the biggest enterprise-scale websites. With Wagtail’s multisite capability, we can combine your whole digital portfolio including websites, intranets and events platforms into one easy to maintain structure with Single Sign On (SSO) authentication.
Improve efficiency and usability by migrating to a new open-source platform.
We’ll seamlessly transfer all of your data and ensure a smooth transition, minimising downtime and disruption to your operations. So you can enjoy using all of the back-office tools you rely on, but in a faster, easier to use and more secure environment.
Custom builds aren’t always the answer.
We can help you fast track development and make rapid progress with scalable, low-code solutions. By taking advantage of pre-built components and powerful development tools, we can streamline the development process without compromising on quality.
Accessibility testing allows us to identify barriers users may come up against, and suggest updates to improve the usability of the site for everyone.
Our comprehensive accessibility audits will give you a clear view of current accessibility levels, areas for improvement and a backlog of improvements to achieve the highest possible levels of accessibility.

Our website is our ‘shop window’ for people seeking advice, information and support so it’s absolutely vital that it’s accessible, intuitive and user-friendly. From the start of our work with Torchbox, inclusive design and accessibility have been the driving force. From feedback on the designs to user testing the site to ensure it is accessible and intuitive, blind and partially sighted people have played an invaluable role in developing the website.
